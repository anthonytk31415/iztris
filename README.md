# iztris
Iztris is a puzzle game that draws inspiration from past block-type puzzle games. Try it! 


Steps: 
0. Set up your development environment:
    - Install a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
    - Choose an IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Code::Blocks)
1. Set up your development environment:
    - Install a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
    - Choose an IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Code::Blocks)
2. Plan your game structure:
    - Define the game board (typically a 2D array)
    - Create classes for Tetromino shapes
    - Design the game loop
3. Implement basic game components: 
    - Create a board class to represent the game grid
    - Implement Tetromino shapes and their movements
    - Develop game class to maange overall game state
4. Set up the main game loop:
    - Handle user input (keyboard controls)
    - Update game state (piece movement, rotation)
    - Check for collisions and line clears
    - Render the game board and current piece
5. Implement game mechanics:
   - Piece rotation
   - Collision detection
   - Line clearing and scoring
6. Piece spawning and game over conditions
7. Add a simple text-based or console graphics:
    - Use ASCII characters to represent blocks and empty spaces
    - Clear the console and redraw the game board each frame
8. Implement additional features:
    - Score tracking
    - Levels and increasing difficulty
    - Next piece preview
    - Basic sound effects (optional)
9. Optimize and refine:
    - Improve code structure and organization
    - Enhance performance if needed
10. Test thoroughly:
    - Play the game extensively
    - Fix any bugs or issues you encounter
11. (Optional) Enhance graphics:
    - If you want to go beyond console graphics, consider using a simple graphics library like SDL2 or SFML
